# ReWire

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mu-chaco/ReWire.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mu-chaco/ReWire)

ReWire is an experimental compiler for a subset of [Haskell](http://haskell.org/) to VHDL, suitable for synthesis and implementation on FPGAs. ReWire enables a semantics-directed style of synchronous hardware development, based on reactive resumption monads. See the [online documentation](http://mu-chaco.github.io/ReWire/) for more information.
